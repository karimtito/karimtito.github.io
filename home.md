### About me

I am a French computer scientist, currently pursuing a Ph.D. in [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en)'s [LinkMedia team](http://www-linkmedia.irisa.fr/) and in [Thales Group](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en)'s [La Ruche team](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/worldwide/news/hive-activity). 
<br>
Both teams are based in [Rennes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rennes), the capital city of the Britanny region.


### Research

My research is focused on Deep Learning models robustness. More precisely the subject of my Ph.D. thesis is the estimation of the reliability of Deep Neural Networks using Rare Event simulation algorithms.
