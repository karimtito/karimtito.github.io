I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Inria Rennes, in the [LinkMedia team](http://www-linkmedia.irisa.fr/) and Thales.


### Research

My research is focused on Deep Learning models robustness. More precisely the subject of my Ph.D. thesis is the estimation of the reliability of Deep Neural Networks using Rare Event simulation algorithms.
