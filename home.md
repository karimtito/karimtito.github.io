### About me

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Luxembourg](https://www.uni.lu), where I am part of the [Security, Reasoning and Validation (SeRVal)](https://serval-snt.github.io/) team within the [Security and Trust (SnT)](https://www.uni.lu/snt-en/) interdisciplinary research centre. Before that, I graduated with a PhD in computer science from the University of Rennes in April 2024, after 3 years of doctoral study spent within [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en)'s [LinkMedia team](http://www-linkmedia.irisa.fr/) and in [Thales Group](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en)'s [La Ruche team](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/worldwide/news/hive-activity). 


### Research

My research is focused on [AI Safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety) and more precisely on AI formal/statistical verification methods. The subject of my [Ph.D. thesis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karimtito/karimtito.github.io/master/Tit_Karim_Phd_Thesis_final.pdf) was the estimation of the reliability of Deep Neural Networks classifiers predictions, using Rare Event simulation algorithms.
