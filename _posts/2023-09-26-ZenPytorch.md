## 17 tips from ChatGPT to stay Zen while using PyTorch

### The Zen of Python 

In 1999, Tim Peters wrote the "Zen of Python", a poem consisting of 19 programming principles aimed at guiding python developpers all around the world. 
These principles have influenced the design of Python ever since and the poem was eventually added to the Python interpreter where it can be displayed by typing '`import this`' in the command prompt.

### The Zen of PyTorch, GPT-style

By prompting ChatGPT one can obtain equivalent poems for PyTorch, a popular Deep Learning framework initially developped by Meta AI and now an open source project supported by the Linux Foundation. The version below offers 17 tips, which in my opinion reflect well on those provided by Peters and are actually quite sensible, for the most part.

>
> 1. Tensors are the foundation, grasp them firmly.
>
> 2. Autograd is the magic, wield it wisely.
>
> 3. Eager is better than lazy, explore and experiment.
>
> 4. Simplicity in API, complexity in models.
>
> 5. Explicit models are better than implicit architectures.
>
> 6. Readability in code, reproducibility in results.
>
> 7. Batch is better than one, parallel is better than serial.
>
> 8. GPU acceleration, the wind beneath your model’s wings.
>
> 9. Be generous with comments, your future self will thank you.
>
> 10. Modularity counts, layer by layer builds the castle.
>
> 11. In the face of ambiguity, refer to the docs.
>
> 12. There should be one – and preferably only one – right way to define a layer.
>
> 13. Although that way may not be obvious unless you’ve read the source.
>
> 14. Now is better than never, but understanding beats rushing.
>
> 15. If the training is hard to debug, revisit your model.
>
> 16. If the results are easy to interpret, you’re onto something.
>
> 17. Experimentation is one honking great idea – let’s do more of those!
